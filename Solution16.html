    <h1>Digital Minimalism</h1>
    <p>“How do you simplify your digital life?” is quickly becoming the question of our generation. Between packed calendars, overflowing inboxes, and the constant pull of social media and news (and Netflix) it can feel like how you spend your time online isn’t really up to you. 

    But what if there was a way to use your technology without feeling used by it? The answer is Digital minimalism. 
        
    Coined by author and computer science professor Cal Newport in his book of the same name, Digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use based on the understanding that our relationship with our apps, tools, and phones is nuanced and deserves more intention than we give it. 
        
    The problem–as Cal sees it– is that email and chat can be both stressful and productive.
        
    Facebook can be both distracting and empowering.
        
    Our phones are equally annoying interruptions and powerful tools for navigating the world.</p>
