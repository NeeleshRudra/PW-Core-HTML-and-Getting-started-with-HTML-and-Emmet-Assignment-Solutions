    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code. Comments are some text or code written in your code to give an explanation about the code, and not visible to the user. Comments which are used for HTML file are known as HTML comments. Anything written between these tags will be ignored by the browser, so comments will not be visible on the webpage.</p>
